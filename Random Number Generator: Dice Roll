<h1>Random Number Generator: Dice Roll</h1>

Below is the Python code that I've discovered online and found it interesting to rewrite.

It was simple default code in a walkthrough tutorial of setting up Visual Studio Code (on initial download) that can be found by clicking [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-and-use-packages).

After practicing in Visual Studio Code and seeing the fruits of this brief code function as a random number generator...

NOTE: This code can run independently, provided the IDE has Numpy Library installed. 
NOTE: Code ran successfully (post-copy & paste) at [Online Python, Beta](https://www.online-python.com/).

Start code:

------------------------------------

import numpy as np

msg = "Roll a dice!"
print(msg)

print(np.random.randint(1,9))

------------------------------------

End Code

I then copied and pasted the code into this randomly searched & discovered web browser-based IDE and ran the code to see success as well.

Output Start:

------------------------------------


Roll a dice!
4

------------------------------------

Output End

## Discussion

This can be replicated in an IDE by:

+ Ensuring Numpy is available.  
  + If needed, NumPy can be installed using the pip package installer. Run the following line in your command prompt or terminal: 

pip install numpy

This will download and install most recent NumPy version from PyPI.
