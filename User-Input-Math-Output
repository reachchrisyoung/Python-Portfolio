<h1>Random Number Generator: Dice Roll</h1>

Below is the Python code that I've discovered online and had taken interest in further understanding & electing to rewrite.

It was simple code found upon initial visit to an online web-browser based IDE prepped for an end user to copy & paste Python program into before running it.

After practicing in Visual Studio and seeing the fruits of this brief code as collecting end user input to modify the output...

I've revisited the project and delved deeper into both replicating and reviewing it.

NOTE: This code can run independently. The code had ran successfully (post-copy & paste) at [Online Python, Beta](https://www.online-python.com/).  Likely, you will see this code at the aforementioned website.

Start code:

------------------------------------

def sum(a, b):
    return (a + b)

a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

print(f'Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')

------------------------------------

End Code

I had ran the code to see successful output from end user inputs...

NOTE: I, the end user at the time of this write-up, had input the values "1" and "2" as the program was executing.

Output Start:

------------------------------------

Enter 1st number: 
1
Enter 2nd number: 
2
Sum of 1 and 2 is 3

------------------------------------

Output End

## Discussion

This can be replicated in an IDE by copy and paste, or simply drafting a variation therein.

def sum(a, b):
    return (a + b)

This portion of the the code illustrates the mathematical operation that will be called upon later.

User input

int(input('Enter 1st number: '))

The above code was replicated then set to two variables: a and b. 

Note: The output statement to prompt the end user did, in fact, get changed for the "b" variable by identifying it a "2nd number" in the output execution.  

Each variable was listed, then set to the above code.  As illustrated:

a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))

Print Statement

This portion has several parts to it:

+ 'Sum of a and b is ' had some additional elements to it.

+ Single quotes, input with the apostraphe key on the QWERTY American keybard, satisifed identifying the output text as just that: text to be displayed to the end user following the submission of the second value (which was set to 'b').

+ Braces placed around {a} and {b} suggest that, even within a string of display text, we are pulling values from somewhere else and inserting them into what will be displayed to the end user upon further code execution.





np.random.randint(1,9) is articulating the randomizer and giving conditions whereby digits can be selected in a range spanning 1 to 9.  NOTE: This is essential for the outpout of this program to run as intended.

Conclusion:

For a simple project, this is a fun item that even younger students can enjoy and learn with.

Next steps for this project can include prompting the end user to give inputs that could then be utilized in the print statement for a range of numbers from which the program can randomly select a number within.
